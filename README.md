# Elf3-MT
**INTERACTIONS OF ELF3 AND DNA METHYL TRANSFERASES IN MESENCHYMAL EPITHELIAL TRANSFORMATION**
## Aim of the study
This Project mainly aims to investigate the impact of Elf3 on DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1, Dnmt3b, Uhrf1) using an integrated approach, including gene modulation and bioinformatics, and to contribute to our epigenetic perspective in the regulation of MET with in vitro experiments to be performed on the NMuMG cell line.
